# School Portal and Database Management

## Description
Embarking on my first solo project, I set out to create a comprehensive solution for a school portal, drawing upon my experiences as a visiting math tutor and my burgeoning expertise gained primarily from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freeCodeCamp.org). This endeavor not only allowed me to test my proficiency in the technologies I've been mastering but also fulfilled a practical need within my work environment.

Utilizing the MERN stack, I meticulously crafted a sophisticated system encompassing a dynamic landing page and robust database management complete with role-based authentication.

## Features
- **Dynamic Landing Page:** Engage users with a visually appealing and informative landing page showcasing key information about the school.
- **Database Management:** Utilize MongoDB to store and manage various types of data relevant to the school, such as student records, course details, and administrative information.
- **Role-Based Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms, allowing different user roles such as administrators, teachers, and students to access appropriate functionalities.

### Frontend Technologies:
- Vite-React
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite-React
- Framer Motion
- Axios
- jsPDF

### Backend Technologies:
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express
- Bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

4. Configure environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
- Define environment variables such as `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, and `JWT_SECRET`.
5. Start the development servers:
6. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Navigate through the different sections of the application using the intuitive user interface.
- Depending on your role (e.g., administrator, teacher, student), access relevant functionalities such as managing student records, creating courses, or viewing academic information.
